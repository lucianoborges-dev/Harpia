# 🦅 Harpia -- A remote vehicle controller simulator

**Harpia** is a personal engineering project inspired by the harpy eagle — strong, sharp‑eyed, and dominant.  
It’s a prototype system for **remote control of multiple vehicles** (trucks, tractors, simulators) through a custom communication protocol, a server bridge, and console‑based terminals.

This project is both a **learning journey** (network protocols, distributed systems, software architecture) and a **portfolio showcase**.

**Inspirations:** JAUS protocol, MODBUS, Asi Mobius software.
